              <p>Our web service aims to be a streamlined and easy-to-use recipe sharing and discovery platform where people 
                can share their recipes with each other. Anyone can browse and search for recipes posted on the web service. 
                We also offer filters for things like included and excluded recipes to facilitate finding recipes that are just 
                perfect for your allergies and/or pantry situation.
              </p>
              <p>Our design philosophy for creating this website was to create a web service with large pictues showcasing the
                creations of our users matched with warm colors and accessible fonts to make it easier for all kinds of people 
                to use. We hope you enjoy using our web service as much as we enjoyed creating it!

              <p>Adding new recipes to the web service is limited to registered users only. If you only want to look at the
                recipes posted by other people, you don't need to feel pressure to register! However, registered users can also 
                bookmark and rate recipes and easily access those recipes later from their account page if they so wish.

              <p>You can start searching for recipes by first either entering a search term into the search bar or start by 
                going to the home page and browsing. Both your search results and all the recipes shown on the home page can be
                filtered by opening up the filtering menu on those pages. Just press the 'Filter' button or icon on the navigation 
                bar when you're on those pages and voil√†! If you want to close the filtering menu, just press the filtering button
                or icon again and it's gone &#8212; your filtering results will still be there.
